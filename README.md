I am a second-year CSU Global student pursuing my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT), specializing in Cloud Computing and Virtualization. After 15 years in the Property Management Industry, I have made the exciting decision to transition into IT. I will move from building, protecting, and maintaining physical assets to doing the same for digital assets. 

As an IT Student, I am eager to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world projects and share my experiences with others. This repository is my central hub for my personal projects, learning resources, and accomplishments in the IT realm.

## Objective

My journey in Information Technology has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity. I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, Information Security Analyst, Jr. Cloud Engineer, or System Administrator.
